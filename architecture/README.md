# Architecture
The following are details pertaining to the environment itself.
> **NOTE:** This is a work in progress.. probably forever.
### Applications and Services
Services hosted in the environment. Some to support the lab, some to support my 
family (internet, work, and fun) - all of them to learn.
- Proxmox
  - Description:
    - Hosting and management of virtual machines and their associated resources.
